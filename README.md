## Ruby Binary Search Tree
***
### General Info

This is part of The Odin Project curriculum.

A binary search tree is a rooted binary tree whose internal nodes each store a key greater than all the keys in the node's left subtree and less than those in its right subtree.

A balanced tree is one where the difference between heights of left subtree and right subtree of every node is not more than 1.

### Assigment
1. Build a Node class, has attribute for the data it stores, left and right children.
2. Build a Tree class that accepts an array when initialized.
3. #build_tree method takes an array and turns into a balanced binary tree.
4. #insert and #delete method which accepts a value to insert/delete.
5. #find method which accepts a value and returns the node with the given value.
6. #level_order method that returns an array of values. This method traverse the tree in breadth-first-order.
7. #inorder,#preorder,#postorder methods that returns an array.
8. #height method which accepts a node and returns its height. Height is the distance from given node to leaf node.
9. #depth method which accepts a node and returns its depth. Depth is the distance from a given node to the tree's root node.
10. #balanced? method which checks if the tree is balanced.
11. #rebalance method which rebalances an unbalance tree.
12. Write a simple driver script.
